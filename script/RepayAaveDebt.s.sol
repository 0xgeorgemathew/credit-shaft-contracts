/**
 * @title RepayAaveDebt
 * @notice A standalone utility script to repay USDC debt in Aave V3 on behalf of another user.
 * @dev This script performs the following actions:
 *      1. Reads the Payer (from private key), Debtor, and Amount from environment variables.
 *      2. Checks that the Payer has enough USDC to make the payment.
 *      3. Approves the Aave V3 Pool to spend the Payer's USDC.
 *      4. Calls `aavePool.repay()` to pay down the debt on behalf of the Debtor.
 *      5. Verifies the state change by checking the Debtor's updated debt amount.
